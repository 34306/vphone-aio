# vphone-aio
1 script run the vphone, already jailbroken with full bootstrap installed

- need brew and python3 íntalled and then `brew install git-lfs` to install git large files
- disable SIP, set amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1
- download or clone full this repo (it might take a while, for me 12GB takes me 20 minutes to finish)
- run the `vphone-aio.sh` script
- make sure your device is free more than 128GB (recommended)
- wait until it merge, when merge is done, it will start extract the whole folder (about 15 minutes)
- you can remove .git and the split file once it's merge done
- connect VNC (using RealVNC or Screen sharing): `vnc://127.0.0.1:5901`
- enjoy
